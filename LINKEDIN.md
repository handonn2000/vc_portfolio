# 🚀 Just built my new 3D Portfolio in 3-4 hours with "Vibe Coding"!

I saw that **Antigravity** was free, so I decided to give it a try. The experience was mind-blowing—I went from zero to a fully deployed 3D portfolio in just **3-4 hours**. 🤯

Here’s how I did it:

1.  **Gemini 3 Pro is amazingly powerful**: I simply uploaded my resume and asked it for ideas and a plan. It generated the entire architecture and design concepts for me.
2.  **True Agentic Workflow**: Antigravity isn't just a chatbot. It automatically opens the browser, takes screenshots, interacts with the page like a real user, detects visual issues, and then **fixes them itself**. Watching it debug in real-time is surreal.
3.  **Complex 3D Made Easy**: I wanted a cool interactive 3D globe. I didn't need to learn the math or deep-dive into the libraries. I just found the correct terms (Three.js, Shaders), asked the AI to do it, and it wrote the custom GPU code perfectly.

This is the future of coding. Less boilerplate, more creativity.
